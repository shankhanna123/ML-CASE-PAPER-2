Project Summary: K-Means Clustering with PCA on Wine Dataset

Overview:
This project demonstrates how to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction 
followed by K-Means clustering on the Wine dataset. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository and includes chemical properties of wine samples classified into three classes.

Steps Followed:

1. Dataset Preparation:
   - The Wine dataset was loaded from scikit-learn.
   - It contains 13 features related to wine chemical analysis and a class label (target).
   - A CSV file with headers was generated for easier use.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - The features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure each feature contributes equally.
   
3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
   - PCA was used to reduce the data to 2 principal components to simplify visualization and improve clustering.
   - Explained variance ratio was printed to understand the importance of each component.

4. K-Means Clustering:
   - K-Means algorithm was applied to the PCA-transformed data with 3 clusters.
   - Clustering performance was evaluated using the silhouette score.

5. Visualization:
   - A 2D scatter plot was created to visualize the clusters formed by K-Means in the PCA-reduced feature space.

Key Libraries Used:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn (StandardScaler, PCA, KMeans, silhouette_score)

Outcome:
- The project successfully shows how PCA improves visualization and can aid clustering.
- Clusters are visibly distinct in the PCA-reduced space, and the silhouette score helps validate clustering quality.

Use Case:
- This method is useful in real-world scenarios where data has many features and reducing dimensionality improves interpretability and clustering efficiency.
